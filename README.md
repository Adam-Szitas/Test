## Prerequisit
I made an API for this project

## RESTART
I had to restart the whole project because the latest had a big list of ERROR messages from nowhere due to (seems like) the differences between versions. So after I reinstalled my npm package seems like it's working fine.


## Components
First "Main" component is gonna be filter.


## Sources
material components I'm gonna grab from here: "https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/overview"

## Service
We need a service for the http request from the API

## Structure
main component: filter
    inside filter component: step components
